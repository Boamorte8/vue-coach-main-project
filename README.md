# Find a Coach project

This project is to put in practice all concepts that I learned in the course.

- Routes
- Store
- Slots
- Components

## Learned concepts

- In the router we have 2 methods:
  - `push` This allows us to navigate to a new route but we can go back to the previous route
  - `replace` This allows us to navigate to a new route and we can't go back to the previous route
